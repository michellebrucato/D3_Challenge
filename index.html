          <h3>Correlations Analysis:</h3>
          <p><b>In Poverty (%):</b> As poverty increases, the % of people who lack healthcare also increases. Texas has the highest % of people lacking healthcare. Those in poverty were also more likely to be smokers and obese, compared to those not in poverty. </p><br>
          <p><b>Median Age:</b> Generally speaking, people over the age of 40 are more likely to have healthcare than those younger than 40. The age with the highest rate of smokers is between 36 and 42.  However, obesity did not seem to have a strong correlation with age.</p><br>
          <p><b>Median Household Income:</b> The higher the median family income, the more likely you are to have healthcare.  This was a strong correlation. Additionally, smoking % decreased as median income increased. And lastly, obesity was more common in households with a lower median income.</p>
          <h3>Interesting Observations:</h3>
          <p>Texas has the 2nd lowest median age and the highest % of people who lack healthcare.  Meanwhile, Vermont has the highest median age and the loweest % of people who lack healthcare. This would support the hypothesis that, on average, young people are more likely to lack healthare compared with older people. </p>
          <p>Utah has the lowest median age and the lowest % of people who smoke.  I bet the scenery there is too beautiful to need a vice.</p>
